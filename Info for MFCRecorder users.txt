How export your model-list. 

Copy from Settings.xml part <ModelsInclude>...</ModelsInclude> to config.yml like this:

includeUids:
    <long>16780615</long>
    <long>19545438</long>
    <long>66066111</long>

And replace with any text editor "<long>" => "- " and "</long>" => "" (without quiotes) like this:

includeUids:
    - 16780615
    - 19545438
    - 66066111
