How export your model-list. 

Copy from Settings.xml part <ModelsInclude>...</ModelsInclude> to config.yml like this:

models:
    <long>16780123</long>
    <long>19545456</long>
    <long>66066789</long>

And replace with any text editor "<long>" => "- uid: " and "</long>" => \n+" mode: 1" (without quiotes; \n - new string) like this:

models:
  - uid: 16780123
    mode: 1
  - uid: 19545456
    mode: 1
  - uid: 66066789
    mode: 1
